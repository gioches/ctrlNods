# Cassandra-Specific Monitoring Modules

This directory contains specialized monitoring scripts designed specifically for Apache Cassandra database clusters.

## Cassandra Monitoring Scripts (to be added)

- `S_QueryLatency.sh` - Query performance metrics and latency analysis
- `S_QueryQueue.sh` - Thread pool monitoring and queue depth analysis
- `S_Balancing.sh` - Data streaming and cluster balancing status
- `S_ClusterState.sh` - Node status and cluster health monitoring
- `S_HINTS.sh` - Hints file monitoring and accumulation tracking
- `S_Partition.sh` - Large partition detection and analysis
- `S_MEM.sh` - Memory usage and garbage collection monitoring

## Cassandra Integration

These modules integrate directly with Cassandra's JMX interface and nodetool commands to provide:
- Real-time cluster health monitoring
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Proactive issue detection
- Capacity planning metrics

## Metrics Overview

| Module | Purpose | Key Metrics |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **S_QueryLatency.sh** | Query Performance | 50th, 95th, 99th percentile latencies |
| **S_QueryQueue.sh** | Thread Pools | Pending queries, blocked operations |
| **S_Balancing.sh** | Data Streaming | Active transfers, streaming duration |
| **S_ClusterState.sh** | Node Status | DOWN, JOINING, MOVING, LEAVING states |
| **S_HINTS.sh** | Hints Files | Hint accumulation, target nodes |
| **S_Partition.sh** | Large Partitions | Oversized partitions, performance impact |
| **S_MEM.sh** | Memory/GC | Garbage collection times, heap usage |

## Enterprise Features

- **Production-Tested**: Validated in NEXI payment systems and PosteItaliane infrastructure
- **Mission-Critical Ready**: Designed for 24/7 operation in enterprise environments
- **False Positive Elimination**: Intelligent filtering to reduce monitoring noise

**Note**: Complete Cassandra monitoring scripts will be available in the next release.
